# Simple Math

This is a simple PHP crud api. It takes input from the user
of two ranges of numbers. One the first submit is pressed
then the random numbers appear where the user picks the operation (addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication). The user does the math then guess the answer. If the answer is correct than the correct tally show up one, with up one on attempts as well. All attempts are recorded in a MySql database.

## Usage

### Get Xampp
First in order to use this on your local computer you will need to download a application called XAMPP here is the link
https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html.

### Follow steps
Once downloaded follow the steps until the window of the app displays. After the display you can choose your servers pick apache and mysql.

### Move repo to Xammp htdocs
Then in your applications folder go to XAMPP and add your clone of this repository into the htdocs of the XAMPP application. Now your server should be running so go to
localhost.
